TUTORIAL OF LARCH:

This program allows you to make truth trees and grade them.

Open up the program in a browser (a newer version of firefox or chrome should
suffice)!

To start with, click the "click here" portion of the node.  This allows you to
type a statement in.  Shortcuts are as follows:

  not:    ¬     ~
  and:    ∧     &
  or:     ∨     |
  cond:   →     ->
  bicon:  ↔     <>

You can use parenthesis.  The buttons at the top of the screen will also type
the symbols out into the statement form.  However, as of now, the symbols will
only be added to the end of the statement, so it is best to learn the shortcuts.

When finished typing the statment, press return on the keyboard.

Now the statement is associated with this node (#0).  If you need to change the
statement, simply click on it again!

Now add a single node.  To do this, press the button with the single square
on the bottom left of the node you just edited.  This should create an identical
node below the one you edited, but with a new number (#1) and the "click here"
statement.  Also notice that the bottom of the node you just clicked changed to
"add/remover check".  We will cover that a little later but first edit the
the statement of the node you just created.

Now press the button with two rectangles on it.  This will create two new blank
nodes with unique numbers below the node you just edited.

Feel free to edit the statements of these nodes.

Next lets add some checks, on node #0 press the "add/remove checks" button.

This will change all of the nodes below it to "add" and the current node to
"done".  Click add on nodes #2 and #3.  These nodes will now change to remove
and also node #0 will display 2 and 3 as checks.  Click done.

Add some new nodes to the tree.

Now on node number 1, click "add/remove checks".  Notice how only the nodes
that haven't been checked yet, and the nodes below number 1 show "add".

On one of the bottom nodes, click the black dot button.  This marks the branch
as open.  The X button will mark it as closed.   Clicking the dot or X again
will unmark it.

Click done and then click the red X button at the top.  This now you can delete
nodes.

Click the blue + sign button at the top.  This allows you to add nodes to any
branch.

Finally click the green check button.  This will turn nodes green, blue, light
blue, or red depending on how it graded them.

    Green: the node was checked, closed, or marked open correctly
    Red: the node was checked, closed, or marked open incorrectly
    Blue: the node's statement has an error
    Light Blue: the node hasn't been added as a check yet

Lastly you might want to save the file.  To do this type a file name into the
top left form on the screen.  Eithe press enter, or click the save button and
the file will be downloaded to your downloads folder.

To open the file, refresh the screen.  Click upload before adding any nodes or
editing the first node.  Find a tree file, and then open it.  Finally, press
the load button and the tree will open.  Give it a second to load if the file is
big.
