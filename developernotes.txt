///////////////////////////////////LARCH////////////////////////////////////////
ABOUT:
Larch is a truth tree proof creating and checking web application.  The project
is similar to Fitch.

PROGRAM:
The program consists of 3 files pretty much.  An HTML file, a CSS file, and a
Javascript file.

DEFAULT.HMTL:
This file contains the html for the program.  The basic HTML structure is as
follows.

BODY------------------------------------------
|CONTAINER------------------------------------
||HEADER--------------------------------------
|||    SAVEFORM/SAVE/LOADFORM/UPLOAD/LOAD/HEADERCENTER
|||
|||
|||
|||
|||
||GREENHOUSE----------------------------------
|||                    NODE
|||
|||
|||
|||
|||
|||

headercenter contains deletemode, editmode, gradework, and the symbol buttons

NODE---------------------------
|NODETOP-----------------------
||          NODETITLE
||
||  CLICKHERE/AFORM/DISPLAYSTATE
||
|NODEBOTTOM-------------------
||
||  SINGLE/DOUBLE/OPEN/CLOSE
||



Nodes are the main things that run the program.  They change often especially
the node bottom.  The above picture depicts the default buttons that show up.
Study the HTML and learn it forwards and backwards, because it is EXTREMELY
critical towards understanding the program.

When either single or double is clicked, new nodes are created.  All nodes
contain the same HTML as the first node object on the screen (they are cloned).

If double is clicked, two new containers are created branchl and branchr. You
can consider these sub greenhouses.  They each contain one node to begin with.

Play around with the program with the browser developer tools open to see how it
works.



STYLE.CSS:
Not much to say about the CSS, it is pretty basic stuff.  Because it all has
visual effects, feel free to change it and see what happens.

TREECREATION.JS:
This is the main javascript that runs the program.  It can probably be broken
down into smaller scripts, although it should be made into one script for final
distribution.  The script has mainly functions, and events.  The events control
the clicks and hovers, the functions are used in different events.  Please see
the file itself for information on all of the functions and events.

OTHER:
As creator of this project, feel free to contact me.  I may not be around, but
if I am I would definitely love to sit down with you and help you figure out the
program (stonek4@rpi.edu).
